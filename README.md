## Topic 1: Introduction to Quirkiness of Utility Analytics

A few fun facts: (1) Wholesale energy price can spike up from median price of $30/MWh to $1000/MWh in a couple of hours or drop down to negative prices. (2) Market design can change behavior of market participants and thus the market itself. (3) “Data scientists” in utilities often do everything from data mining, model prototyping to production model engineering and support.

There is so much analytics to be done with utility data. I’ll share a map of utility analytics and a few use cases.

## Topic 2: Azure Cloud Architecture for Data Workloads

Cloud solutions from AWS and Azure offer the ability to quickly standup environments that scale as you grow your solution. In this presentation, we'll provide an overview of the Microsoft Azure architecture we are using at The Energy Authority to process Smart Meter data and apply Data Science services across large datasets. We'll provide some lessons learned from real world development using Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL, and Azure Data Bricks.
